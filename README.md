Here’s a **clean and professional README.md structure** for your **BlackHole3D** project, with the file structure included in a nicely formatted section.

```markdown
# BlackHole3D

BlackHole3D is a 3D rendering project built with **C**, using the **MiniLibX** graphics library and a custom **Libft** implementation.  
It follows the [Cub3D](https://github.com/42School) project style from 42 School, simulating a basic raycasting engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.

If you want, I can also make a **more visual version** with emojis for each file/folder and add **build badges** for GitHub, which makes it look very polished. That style usually makes your README stand out.  

Do you want me to make that version?
